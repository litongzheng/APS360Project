      "Cartman: Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?! \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life! \n",
      "Stan: Oh Jesus, here we go. \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club. \n",
      "Stan: We don't wanna hear it. \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phinehas!  Phinehas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers,  but every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beat him to it.  Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas!  Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal.  But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal. \n",
      "Stan: Immortal. \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies.  And when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos.  Phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. Until he was hit by a train in 1892.  \n",
      "Kyle: ...Do you realize how retarded that sounds? \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years? \n",
      "Stan: Yeah, it's way, way more retarded. \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. I'm afraid we're going to have to... ask you to leave.  \n",
      "Stan: We're not leaving without Chef. \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: If you choose not to leave, then I'm afraid we're just going to have to ... call security and make you leave.  You'll be let out by security and it will be super-embarrassing and everyone here will see!  Okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they won't leave, it's really frustrating? \n",
      "Kyle: We're not going anywhere without Chef. \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome.  You petulant fools! You just had to push it, didn't you? You don't realize who you're dealing with here. Security!  Take these boys to the door. \n",
      "Guard 1: All right, come on kids. \n",
      "Kyle: No! Hey! \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Haha! Look they're being led out by security! Haha! \n",
      "Stan: No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room! \n",
      "Guard 2: This is their house and they don't want you here.  \n",
      "Kyle: Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend! \n",
      "William: And sex with Eskimo children requires some special skills.  \n",
      "Kyle: Chef, come on! \n",
      "Chef: Children! \n",
      "William: Get out of here! \n",
      "Cartman: Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash! \n",
      "Kenny: (Yeeeeehah!)  \n",
      "Stan: Come on, Chef! \n",
      "Chef: I can't... break these locks.  \n",
      "Kyle: Here!  \n",
      "Cartman: Run Chef! \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: What the-? Impossible! I made them leave! \n",
      "Kyle: Get outside!  \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Stop them!  \n",
      "Chef: Children! Run!  \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Stop!  \n",
      "Stan: We made it! \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Don't you remember why you left South Park in the first place??  \n",
      "Stan: Chef, come on! \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty! \n",
      "Kyle: Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef? \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Don't forget all your training, Chef! Stay with us and your life will be GRAND and ETERNAL! \n",
      "Stan: Chef, we love you. \n",
      "Chef: I'm sorry children.  \n",
      "Kyle: No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that?? \n",
      "Chef: Get the hell out of here, children!! \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Yesss. Looks like our fruity little club is safe after all.  NO!  \n",
      "The Boys: Chef!  \n",
      "Chef: Ack.  Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit!  Ah- Awww!  \n",
      "Stan: NO!  \n",
      "Cartman: A mountain lion!  \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: We can't lose another member! Shoot it!  \n",
      "Chef: Ah! \n",
      "Marksman: All right, this!  \n",
      "Kyle: CHEF!  \n",
      "Cartman: A grizzly bear! \n",
      "Stan: Oh my God... They killed Chef. \n",
      "Kyle: You bastards. YOU BASTARDS! \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Pity. He would have made an excellent child molester.  \n",
      "Cartman: Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your- \n",
      "Chef: POOOT!  \n",
      "Cartman: Oh never mind. \n",
      "Stan: Come on, let's go.  \n",
      "Kyle: We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains. \n",
      "Randy: Yeah. \n",
      "Mr. Mackey: He's right.  \n",
      "Kyle: And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all.  \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Is it working? Is it working? \n",
      "Tech: Yes. We've got a pulse! \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Get him in the ICU suit! Hurry!  We have done it! Good! Raise him up!  Chef, can you hear me? Say something. \n",
      "Darth Chef: Hello there, children. How would you like some Salisbury steak? \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Yes, go on. \n",
      "Darth Chef: And for desert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls? \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Oh? You mean like a chocolate candy? \n",
      "Darth Chef: No, I mean my balls. \n",
      "Mr. Connolly: Yes, YES! Hahahahahahaaa! \n",

      "Kyle: Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off!  \n",
      "Driver: Hey, is that a hybrid? \n",
      "Gerald: Oh yes. You've got one too, I see. \n",
      "Driver: Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway,  good for you! \n",
